# 🎬 BookMyShow Clone (Simplified)

A simplified online movie ticket booking system built for academic demonstration. This project allows users to browse movies, theatres, and shows, check seat availability, and book tickets.

The backend is powered by **Java Spring Boot**, utilizing an **H2 In-Memory Database** for data storage, while the frontend interacts via standard **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**.

* **Movie Management:** Add and view movie details (Title, Genre, Duration).
* **Theatre Management:** Manage theatre locations.
* **Show Management:** Schedule shows by linking movies to theatres at specific times.
* **Smart Seat Management:** Automatic seat generation for every new show added.
* **Booking System:** Real-time seat availability checks and double-booking prevention.
* **Frontend Interface:** Simple web pages to interact with the API.
* **User Authentication:** Login and registration implemented with JWT
* **Booking Confirmation:** Booking confirmation sent through Email

## ⚠️ Limitations

  * **Data Persistence:** Since this uses an **H2 In-Memory database**, all data (movies, bookings, etc.) will be wiped when the application is restarted.
  * **Payment:** Payment gateway integration is not included; the system focuses on the booking logic.
  * **Concurrency:** Basic double-booking prevention is implemented, but advanced locking mechanisms are not included.
